# Secure Internet Access

The continuous and exponential increase in bandwidth, expansive user mobility, and the shift of applications to the cloud has made it an absolute must for enterprises to secure user internet access. Since users and devices are the new network perimeter, it must be done in the cloud.

The demand for remote work has made appliance-based network security strategies unsustainable as the projected increases in bandwidth consumption combined with backhauled mobile traffic will quickly saturate the maximum capacity of any on-prem appliance architecture.

The erosion of the network perimeter due to increased use of cloud apps and services further accelerates this backhauling, resulting in a poor end-user experience and lower productivity due to latency. Citrix Secure Internet Access (Citrix SIA) shifts the focus from defending perimeters to following users to ensure internet access is secure regardless of location.

Citrix SIA uses a “Zero Trust” role-based policy model. One of the core goals of Zero Trust is to assign policies and manage access to resources based on a user’s role and identity. This foundational concept is built into the Citrix SIA platform’s policy engine.

Citrix SIA delivers comprehensive internet security to all users in all locations including:

*  Complete web & content filtering
*  Malware protection
*  Protection for outdated browsers & OS
*  SSL/TLS traffic management
*  CASB, cloud apps & social media controls
*  Advanced, real-time reporting
*  Flexible data traffic redirection for any device, anywhere
