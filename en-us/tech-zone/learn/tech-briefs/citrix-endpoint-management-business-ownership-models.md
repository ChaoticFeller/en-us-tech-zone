# Unified Endpoint Management Ownership Models

## Business Ownership Models 
Starting with Unified Endpoint Management will mean that you need to have information on business ownership models and management options. Most important are the business ownership models and the technical related management options of these ownership models. A Business Ownership Model describes in basics who owns the device and what and who manages the device partially or fully from an IT management perspective. A business ownership model can also use to correlate into security needs, responsibility and liability of the data and apps used on a device. All the different business needs, personal or business usage of apps and data have resulted into the following most common business ownership models used.

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
Bring Your Own Device **(BYOD)** means that employees can use their own smartphones, laptop and tablets for their work. With BYOD there can be some Legal Complications in the event of a loss, virus or data breach, the use of your own device also causes legal complications. For example, who is responsible where appropriate? And is the company allowed to maintain its ICT policy in full on private devices?

### Choose Your Own Device (CYOD)
Choose Your Own Device **(CYOD)** means that employees can choose a device from a pre-approved list of devices types and models by the employer. With this approach, not only the IT department will be satisfied, as it makes managing the devices very easy; the employee will also be satisfied with it, because there is still a certain freedom of choice in the devices they need for their work.

### Company Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)
Company Owned, Personally Enabled **(COPE)** is one of the two policies that an organization can implement for a Choose-Your-Own-Device policy. The employee may choose from a list of devices selected in advance by the organization. The device is purchased and managed by the organization but may also be used by the employee for private purposes.

### Company Owned, Business Only (COBO)
Company Owned, Business Only **(COBO)** is the business model where companies supply the employee with a device purchased and managed by the company to use and restrict this hardware for business use only, private use is prohibited. Employees often werenâ€™t given a choice for what device they would have.
