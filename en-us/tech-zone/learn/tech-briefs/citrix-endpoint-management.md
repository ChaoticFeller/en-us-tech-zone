# Unified Endpoint Management

## About Citrix Endpoint Management
Citrix Endpoint Management is an industry acknowledged Unified Endpoint Management aka UEM solution offered through the Citrix Cloud as a Service. Unified Endpoint Management solutions offer a single uniform over-the-air management interface for mobile, laptops, personal computers and other devices like wearables and IoT endpoints. Citrix Endpoint Management provides a flexible choice in platform management, ownership models (Bring Your Own Device, Choose Your Own Device, Company Owned - Personally Enabled and Company Owned – Business Only) and delivery models for securing the endpoint, applications, the connections and data. 

Thereby enabling user’s productivity for current and future business use cases (Frontline Worker, Single-Purpose, Office Worker, Signage/Kiosk). Unified Endpoint Management is one of the fundamental pillars in the Zero Trust framework and Future Ready Secure Workspaces initiatives to providing insights to the device compliance and health posture, applications and connections used. This information is fed into analytics systems so that Risk profiles can be created and Continues Adaptive Risk and Assessment can take place. Unified Endpoint Management embeds cross-platform security into organizations onboarding processes of users, endpoints and applications helping to streamline modern workspace strategies and cloud security.

## The Evolution of Device Management 
Enterprises initially turned to **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** solutions to manage their devices. MDM not only centralized device management, but it also gave I.T the ability to perform remote configurations and updates, and efficiently deliver applications and data to mobile endpoints. MDM helped I.T. organizations overcome early bring-your-own-device (BYOD) challenges, such as onboarding and large-scale management.

**Mobile Application Management (MAM)** emerged soon after MDM and focused on securing and managing applications as individual components. MAM offers a similar set of policies and user experience management as MDM, but at a different application level rather than the device level. Since then, MAM has expanded to encompass app-level control of secured (Micro) VPN, inter-container communication, and secure containers.

**Unified Endpoint Management (UEM)** has recently emerged as the market standard for securing and controlling any corporate or personal devices, including any other devices like Iot and wearables. Unified Endpoint Management provides the ability to centrally and over the air, to discover, provision, manage, deploy, update and maintain all in a cohesive manner from a single console. **Citrix Endpoint Management Service (CEM)** is the Unified Endpoint Management technology from Citrix that transforms the workspace experience to support every endpoint and brings unification in IT administration.
