## Overview

As people consume more SaaS-based applications, organizations must be able to unify access to all apps and simplify login operations while still enforcing authentication standards. It’s also crucial to monitor vendor SLAs and application utilization and security analytics.
Citrix Secure Workspace Access is a set of capabilities that delivers instant Single-Sign On (SSO) access to SaaS and web applications, granular and contextual security policies, app protection policies for all apps, browser isolation and web filtering policies.
Citrix Secure Workspace Access goes beyond basic access and aggregation to provide IT with policy controls, known as cloud app control, that provide conditional access to cloud apps and internet browsing, enhancing the organization’s overall security and compliance posture. The user’s experience remains seamless and integrated because the SaaS and web apps can be accessed alongside their mobile and virtual apps and desktops as an integrated part of Citrix Workspace.
Secure Workspace Access combines elements of several Citrix Cloud services to deliver an integrated experience for end users and administrators:

*  Web and SaaS SSO
*  Web filtering policies
*  Cloud app control
*  Secure Browser service
*  App protection policies
*  Contextual and granular security policies
*  Workspace app

Citrix Workspace aggregates all resources into a single, personalized user interface. End users can either opt for a locally installed Workspace App (desktop and mobile) or use their local browsers to access a web-based workspace. Regardless of the selected approach and the chosen device, the experience remains familiar and consistent.
